# Multi-Agent AI for Software Development

This project is completed as a requirement for the course **COMP.CS.530-2024-2025-2 Capstone Project on LLM Fine-Tuning** at **Tampere University**. It explores how **multiple AI agents** can collaborate to assist in software development tasks, such as requirement analysis, code generation, testing, and compliance. The goal is to create a system where specialized AI agents work together seamlessly to solve complex development challenges.

## End Goal
Build a **proof-of-concept multi-agent AI system** that:
1. Analyzes requirements and generates specifications.
2. Writes and reviews code using specialized agents.
3. Optimizes performance and ensures compliance.
